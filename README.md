# Robotic-Battery-Modeling

This repository presents the work related to the development of a battery model used in mobile robotics applications. The main goal moreover is the identification of the most suitable SoC and SoH algorithm according to the robot's purpose. This will be achieved by comparing and assessing the different performances of the analyzed SoC and SoH algorithms. 

The work is divided into two sections: 


### Battery Modeling 

In this section it is presented the approaches employed in modeling the battery and extracting the data 

### SoC & SoH 

This section is dedicated to the development and evaluation of the implemented SoC and SoH algorithms
